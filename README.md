# Data Wrangling Projects
## Purpose
This repository includes projects from Data Wrangling (QBS 181) at Dartmouth College. I have received permission from the instructor to make my code public.

## Description of subdirectories

### Project 1
This project cleaned demographics data from the Demographics table from the Dartmouth QBS181 provided by DHMC. 

### Project 2
This project cleaned demographics data from the Demographics, Conditions and TextMessages tables from the Dartmouth QBS181 provided by DHMC. 

### Midterm
This project cleaned the Diabetes dataset (DIQ_I) provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The dataset contained various problems (e.g., missing values, numeric columns stored as chars, etc.), which were addressed and cleaned accordingly.

### Final
This project investigated blood pressure data, obtaining patients' enrollment dates from demographics data (provided by the DHMC database) and calculating average Blood Pressure scores (1 or 0) over 12-week intervals. It also merged three datasets (Demographics, Conditions and TextMessages tables) to obtain the latest sent text dates.
